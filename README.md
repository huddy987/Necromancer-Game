You are a necromancer inhabiting a forgotten forest when a siege of knights storms your dwelling with no mercy. Moving yourself using W, A, S, D allows you to glide accross the map dodging the ruthless knights. Along the way you realize you have some special abilities. Pressing the space bar while moving allows you to shoot a power surge along your path of motion. You also realize that as you kill the knights, they turn into graves and you may resurrect the fallen by hovering over the location of their passing. As a token of gratitude, they join your army and help protect you from other knights by controlling them with the mouse.
